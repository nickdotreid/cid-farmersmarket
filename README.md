=================

CID stands for Citizen Interactive Design, 
a program at the University of Michigan School of Information 
that pairs groups of graduate students with officials from the City of Jackson, Michigan.

The Farmers' Market website provides a forum for Farmers Market event organizers to seek volunteers for each event they sponsor at the [Grand River Farmers' Market](http://mifma.org/farmers-markets/downtown-jackson-grand-river-farmers-market/).  Volunteers can go to a page for each event where they register and the admin and organizers can then see who has registered for each event.

This, and a site for another group of students, is my first full-blown [MEAN-stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN) site, so I had to climb a learning curve which I am very grateful because it's something I wanted to learn.  It also uses [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).  These are some powerful tools that are already changing people's exptectations for websites.
